```
$ python
#After entering the python shell, run the following lines.

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print(sess.run(hello))

#You should see prompts about GPU messages

```
(tensorflow)C:> conda install -c menpo opencv
```

2. Install all the required Python packages

```
(tensorflow)C:> pip install matplotlib pillow lxml
```

## Install Tensorflow:Object Detection
1. Clone this repository

```
$ git clone http://172.16.15.205/ainvr/object_detection.git
```

2. Download the protoc 3.4.0 binary for Windows. [Download Link](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.4.0/protoc-3.4.0-win32.zip). Unzip the  bin/protoc.exe to the directory which contains the object_detection repo.

3. Compile the prototxt for the detection API

```
#From the corresponding directory 
$ protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```

4. Add a new environment variable PYTHONPATH, add the path of object_detection/slim

5. Download the trained <b>faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco model</b>. [Download Link](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_08.tar.gz). Unzip it to the object_detection directory. 

6. Run a simple dmeo
```
#From the object_detection directory
$ python detector.py

```

# Tensorflow Object Detection API
Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of
TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection
models.  At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our
computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from
you if you find this API useful.  Finally if you use the Tensorflow Object
Detection API for a research publication, please consider citing:

## Release information

### June 15, 2017

In addition to our base Tensorflow detection model definitions, this
release includes:

* A selection of trainable detection models, including:
  * Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet,
